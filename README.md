shell-scripts
=============

This is a demonstration repository.

This is a collection of simple shell script utilities that might be useful to someone working on Mac OSX.  They use standard UNIX utilities such as _tr_, _sed_, and _awk_ to transform the formatting of text (as opposed to binary) files.
